Liyan is a Palestianian/Jordanian interaction designer and digital storyteller based in Abu Dhabi, who studies Interactive Media with a concentration in Computer Science at New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD). In the summer of 2021, she obtained a Google Specialization in UX design.
</br>
Her primary interests include UX/UI design, digital storytelling, decolonizing arts and technology and the social implications of the internet. She is interested in multimedia art and content that has the power to influence someone's emotions, views and awareness of their surroundings. With a technical background, she is interested in challenging the notions of how we view and understand new emerging technologies by looking at ways digital tools could be used to elevate the art of storytelling.
</br>
Along with her personal projects, she worked as a researcher at OpenGulf, a set of interconnected digital projects focusing on the historical documentation of the Gulf. She worked on developing the project's website, data analysis and manipulation, visualizing the data in the form of visually stimulating maps, and training a HTR model to transcribe handwritten Gulf archives from the 19th century. The project was presented at multiple conferences including the Middle East Librarians Association, Middle Eastern Studies Association, and Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis at Stanford University. She also worked with a research team at NYUAD on expanding the global discourse of the Interactive Media curriculum outside the Western canon by researching, analyzing and annotating theory and new media arts by non-Western scholars and artists.

<p id="art">
We live in this digitized world where people talk more but say less. Growing up with a mainly STEM education, the emphasis on art around me was very limited. I was learning how to write these algorithms and understand how a computer works while simultaneously reading about how these black box technologies are amplifying the inequalities in the world. All while growing up with the internet - and watching interactions become progressively more digital, yet less stimulating. This made me increasingly more interested in looking at how digital literacy changes the way we interact with the technologies that influence the world around us. Discovering the field where art and technology are not mutually exclusive, I started reevaluating art through a different lens. To me, art is fluid and extensive; itâ€™s everywhere, it navigates through societal borders and barriers and communicates ideas and expressions in a way no other medium can.
</br>
I find it hard to isolate my areas of interest since interactive media practice is very interconnected - which is why I consider myself an interaction designer and digital storyteller. My work ranges from using data to create interactive maps that help people interpret data visually to digital storytelling pieces exploring themes of social good and activism. I create these interactive pieces because it allows me to immerse myself and the users into these digital tools that are perceived as foreign while exploring ideas, themes and stories that are actually familiar to us. As living online increasingly becomes the norm, my work explores ways in which the internet/digital entertainment environments could be used as means of activism and education about what is happening in the world.
</br>
My work also explores ways in which technology impacts and designs our behaviors, views and thoughts. I want my work to globalize and decolonize art and technology and raise awareness of global issues in an accessible, informative and engaging way to provoke change on a global scale.
