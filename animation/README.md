# Birthday Fiesta 
## By Liyan, Lucy, Tobbi, Marta

### Project Description:
For our comics assignment, we decided to create an interactive narrative that follows a baking tutorial for a birthday. We wanted the theme of the website to match the narrative and therefore, the color palette, the typeface and the illustrations were bright and cartoon-like to build on that happy, celebratory theme. 

### Process:

Our concept included a tutorial embedded into the narrative and so part of the experience we were striving to achieve was a tutorial-like educational feel while still being part of a greater story. To achieve that combination of experiences in one website, we had to use some of the panels to frame the story instead of having them all as part of the tutorial. We also wanted our story to be interactive but not messy. Therefore, in order to achieve that, we decided to incorporate signifiers into our interactions which will make the process of interacting with our website more intuitive and clean.

We strategically placed texts, images and buttons in a way that flows naturally for the audience. Since we laid out the comics vertically, we placed elements that we wanted the audience to read first at the top, then placed other elements in a chronological order. Specifically for panel 4, we added a javascript code (___.innerText) because we had 3 different things happening on the same panel. To make the interactions flow with the images, we initiated the code so that the text relevant to the image appears only when the button is clicked. Also, to provide the comic-aesthetics to the website, we obtained the color palette used to create the illustrations, to stylize the buttons and the background color. The image panels were also made to pop out from the screen using the drop shadow for an interactive experience.

### Reflection/Evaluation: 
I think the website turned out to be similar to what we initially thought and planned for. However at some points, I did not anticipate the technical complexities of some concepts and ideas when implementing. I particularly noticed that not necessarily when implementing the concepts since HTML and Javascript are languages that are very well documented but when walking through all the different actions the user might take when interacting with our website and making sure it performs well. This was particularly challenging because we had different events acting on the same objects. The use of timers helped solve many of those situations.
