<p> This is one of 4 videos that are part of the 30 minute film festival at the communications lab at NYUAD. It features the four of us (learn more about us here!) answering four questions about ourselves. While the video might seem boring, the smoothness of the transitions make it an aesthetically pleasing 90 second video. During these times when creativity in content production is limited in the sense of filming, video production and editing becomes vital in the production of content that is engaging. Therefore, this video provides an example of how completely separate clips filmed at completely separate locations could be combined to create a short yet captivating video. <br>  </p>
