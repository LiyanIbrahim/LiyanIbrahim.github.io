      <p id="maincontent1">
      He is quiet and so am I. </br>
He sips tea with lemon, while I drink coffee.</br>
That's the difference between us.</br>
Like me, he wears a wide, striped shirt,</br>
and like him, I read the evening paper.</br>
He doesn't see my secret glance.</br>
I don't see his secret glance.</br>
He's quiet and so am I.</br>
He asks the waiter something.</br>
I ask the waiter something…</br>
</p>

<p id="maincontent1">
A black cat walks between us.</br>
I feel the midnight of its fur</br>
and he feels the midnight of its fur…</br>
I don't say to him: The sky today </br>
is clear and blue.</br>
He doesn't say to me: The sky today is clear.</br>
He's watched and the one watching </br>
and I'm watched and the one watching.</br>
I move my left foot.</br>
He moves his right foot.</br>
</p>
<p id="maincontent1">
I hum the melody of a song</br>
and he hums the melody of a similar song.</br>
I wonder: Is he the mirror in which I see myself?</br>
And turn to look in his eyes…but I don't see him.</br>
I hurry from the café.</br>
I think: Maybe he's a killer…</br>
or maybe a passerby who thinks</br>
I am a killer.</br>
He's afraid…and so am I.</br>
