		<p id="maincontentsound"><a id="link5" href="https://aliawaleed.github.io/soundassignment/#">Whoâ€™s Guilty</a> is a sound piece structured like a story that lives on an interactive webpage. The story walks the user through a murder mystery story that follows along an investigator interrogating 3 suspects for the murder of a woman that is closely related to them. We created an experience where the users are introduced to the murder and suspects through an investigation. Therefore, the users would be listening to the investigation as a means to piece together the different components of the characters surrounding the murder. This immersive storytelling experience is made interactive by giving the user the opportunity to pick what character they want to skip to their part and is participatory by allowing them to choose the murderer.</br>
This experience focuses of enhancing the following: </br>
 Well-written, clear story - Original, well-edited sound work utilizing audio editing softwares - Design & user experience - Web implementation
