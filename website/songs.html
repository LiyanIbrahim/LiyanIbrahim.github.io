 <a id="songlink"href="https://liyanibrahim.github.io/web_art/song1.html">"I want to sing but I donâ€™t know any songs"</a> is an interactive web art experience that delves into the world of childhood lullabies, exploring songs that carry themes of war, displacement, and sorrow. Through fragmented melodies and visuals, the project reflects the duality of lullabies as both soothing and laden with inherited trauma. Visitors are invited to navigate the sounds and stories behind these lullabies, uncovering the ways in which songs meant to comfort are woven with the grief and resilience of communities shaped by conflict. This project captures the silent weight of memories passed down through generations, suspended between innocence and loss.
