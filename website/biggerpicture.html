<p id="maincontentbiggerpic"> <a id="link7" href="https://liyanibrahim.github.io/understandingIMFinal/index.html">The Bigger Picture</a> is a virtual exhibition that I curated along with 3 other students.  Interested in exploring the creation of these narratives through interactive art, The Bigger Picture aspires to delve into the different narratives in themes including religious art, nature/environmental art, activism, and ideas pertaining to bodies. The exhibition analyzes an emerging pattern of difference in the Western vs. decolonized perspective. With many works from the west gaining attention and spotlight, it is important to look beyond the accessible in order to discover the beauty of the decolonial narrative that is often overlooked. </br>
