		<p id="maincontentvideo">This is a video piece that lives on a web page made in a group of 4 students. We adapted a “how to” prompt into giving a tutorial that is unrealistic/unachievable, <a id="link6" href="https://liyanibrahim.github.io/Video_Assignment/page1.html">How to make a human Being?</a>. Since our concept was more abstract that is disguised as something more conventional, the project has both real, physical components as well as animated parts through the videos. </br>
This experience focuses of enhancing the following:  </br>
Well-written, clear story - Video + animation/effects production - Video + animation/effects editing - Web implementation</br>
