<div id="move">
  <div id="mydivheader1">Chubby cheeks, dimple chin </br>

Rosy lips, teeth within</br>

Curly hair, very fair</br>

Eyes are blue, lovely too</br>

Teacher's pet, is that you ?</br>

Yes! Yes! Yes!</br></div>
</div>

<!-- div2 -->
<div id="move2">
  <div id="mydivheader2">Oh, sleep, my darling,</br>
If you'd like a star from the sky I'll give you one.</br>
All children, even the bad ones,</br>
Are already asleep,</br>
Only you are not</br></div>

<!-- div3 -->
<div id="move3">
  <div id="mydivheader3">There was an old woman who lived in a shoe.</br>
  	She had so many children, she didn’t know what to do;</br>

She gave them some broth without any bread;</br>

Then kissed them all soundly and put them to bed.</br></div>

<div id="move4">
  <div id="mydivheader4">A sparrow stood at my window. </br>
And said “Oh, little one. </br>
Hide me with you</br>
I beg you.”</br>
I said, “Where are you from?”</br>
“From the limits of the sky,” he said.</br>
I said “Where did you come from?”</br>
“From the neighbor’s house” he answered.</br>
I said, “What are you afraid of?”</br>
“I escaped from the cage”, he said</br>
I said “What are your feathers?”</br>
“Fate took care of them,” he said.</br>
A tear fell on his cheek.</br></div>
</div>

<div id="move5">
  <div id="mydivheader5">Ring around the Rosie, </br>
  a pocket full of posies, </br>
ashes, </br>
ashes, </br>
we all fall down.</br></div>
</div>

<div id="move6">
  <div id="mydivheader6">Sleep, little one.</br>

If you don’t sleep,</br>

The crab will eat you.</br></div>

<div id="move8">
  <div id="mydivheader8">Bium bium bambaló</br>
Bambaló and dilidillidó</br>
My little friend I lull to rest</br>
But outside, a face looks at the window</br>
When the cruel storms rage</br>
And the dark blizzard crouches above,</br>
I shall light five candles</br>
And drive away the winter shadows.</br>
 </div>
</div>
<div id="move9">
  <div id="mydivheader9">Cover your eyes,</br>
Oh!</br>
The Oloro is coming,</br>
Oh!</br>
Go and hide,</br>
Oh!</br>
Should I open them?</br>
Open, open, open them!</br>
Open, open, open them!</br>
Whoever he finds will be killed,</br>
Oh!</br>
