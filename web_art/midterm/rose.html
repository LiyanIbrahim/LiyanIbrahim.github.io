	Put it on record.
</br>
</br>
    I am an Arab
</br>
</br>
And the number of my card is fifty thousand
</br>
</br>
I have eight children
</br>
</br>
And the ninth is due after summer.
</br>
</br>
What's there to be angry about?
</br>
</br>
Put it on record.
</br>
</br>
I am a name without a title,
</br>
</br>
Patient in a country where everything
</br>
</br>
Lives in a whirlpool of anger.
</br>
</br>
    My roots
</br>
</br>
    Took hold before the birth of time
</br>
</br>
    Before the burgeoning of the ages,
</br>
</br>
    Before cypress and olive trees,
</br>
</br>
    Before the proliferation of weeds.
</br>
</br>
My father is from the family of the plough
</br>
</br>
