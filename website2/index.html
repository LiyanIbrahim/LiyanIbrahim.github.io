They did not recognize me in the shadows </br>
That suck away my color in this Passport</br>
And to them my wound was an exhibit</br>
For a tourist Who loves to collect photographs</br>
They did not recognize me,</br>
Ah... Don't leave</br>
The palm of my hand without the sun</br>
Because the trees recognize me</br>
Don't leave me pale like the moon!</br>
</p>

<p id="maincontent1">
All the birds that followed my palm</br>
To the door of the distant airport</br>
All the wheatfields</br>
All the prisons</br>
All the white tombstones</br>
All the barbed Boundaries </br>
All the waving handkerchiefs</br>
All the eyes</br>
were with me,</br>
But they dropped them from my passport </br>
</p>
<p id="maincontent1">
Stripped of my name and identity?</br>
On soil I nourished with my own hands?</br>
Today Job cried out</br>
Filling the sky:</br>
Don't make and example of me again!</br>
Oh, gentlemen, Prophets,</br>
Don't ask the trees for their names</br>
Don't ask the valleys who their mother is</br>
From my forehead bursts the sward of light</br>
And from my hand springs the water of the river</br>
All the hearts of the people are my identity</br>
So take away my passport!</br>
